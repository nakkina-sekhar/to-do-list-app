Task Title: To-Do List Application Development

Task Description:

The objective of this task was to develop a To-Do List application using React.js. The application should allow users to add, delete, update, and mark tasks as completed or pending. Additionally, it should include features such as task prioritization and filtering.

Steps Taken:

1. Set up the project structure and installed necessary dependencies using npm.
2. Created components for adding tasks (`AddTaskForm`), updating tasks (`UpdateForm`), and displaying tasks (`ToDo`).
3. Implemented state management using React's `useState` hook to manage the list of tasks and other temporary states.
4. Developed functionalities for adding, deleting, updating, and marking tasks as completed or pending.
5. Implemented conditional rendering to display either the add task form or the update form based on user actions.
6. Applied CSS styling to enhance the visual appeal and user experience of the application.

Challenges Faced:

1. Managing state and props effectively to ensure proper data flow between components.
2. Implementing update functionality while maintaining the integrity of task data.
3. Ensuring responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility of the application.
4. Optimizing code structure and performance to enhance the application's efficiency.

Solutions Implemented:

1. Utilized React's state management capabilities to manage task data and user interactions efficiently.
2. Implemented robust error handling and validation mechanisms to handle edge cases gracefully.
3. Conducted thorough testing and debugging across different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility.
4. Adopted best practices for code organization and optimization to improve application performance.

Learnings:

1. Enhanced proficiency in React.js development, including state management, component lifecycle, and hooks.
2. Improved understanding of responsive design principles and CSS styling techniques for creating visually appealing user interfaces.

Project Update:

Successfully completed Task 3 of the internship by developing a fully functional To-Do List application using React.js. The application allows users to manage their tasks seamlessly, with features for adding, updating, deleting, and filtering tasks based on priority and status.
